It was introduced in the paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), which was introduced in June 2021 by a team of researchers at Google Brain. And first released in [this repository](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models). I trained this model with PyTorch. I think the most different thing between using the transformer to train on an image and on a text is in the tokenizing step. ")
